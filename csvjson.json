The Matthew 25:40 facility is a home within the Mustard Seed Communities which serves young boys who were born with HIV, some of whom are orphans and others abandoned by family members. The project is one of its kind in Jamaica and the wider Caribbean and aims to provide a framework for the young men to transition into independent living and become productive citizens.  KCNSA has partnered with a number other organisations and individuals to engage the young men in various activities on a monthly basis and includes rap sessions led by our members or other experts, basic computer training, book donations, expansion of rabbit rearing and farming for market, sporting activities and field trips to expose the young men to various aspects of live.  We have also provided medical checks for the young men and have invited an adult male living with the various to give special talks to them so they can see that they too can live a normal independent life.  The ultimate aim, which will be done in the latter part of the Administration, is to demolish and rebuild a transitional residential facility for the young men to live in comfort.  This will see them stating the practice of independent living prior to transition into society as an independent adult.  "
